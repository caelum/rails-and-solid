# Configuring

In order not to refactor Rails completely, the easiest solution is to just trick it
and make it believe you have the controller he wants, just trick him:

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    
    protect_from_forgery
    include RailsAndSolid::TrickHim
  
  end
